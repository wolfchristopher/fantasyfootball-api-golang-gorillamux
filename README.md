# fantasyfootball-api-golang-gorillamux

This is a project in which I use golang and the gorilla mux library to build out an API. This API pulls data from yahoo's fantasy football api. The data is then converted into a useable format and then put into a GCP mySQL database where people can then call the API and get formatted fantasy football data.
